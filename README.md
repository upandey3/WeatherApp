# WeatherApp
WeatherApp is an iOS App built with Xcode 8 and Swift 3 that gives you the weather of any city using web scraping.
A url request is sent to "http://www.weather-forecast.com/locations/" and the data for a specific city is downloaded
and scraped for the 3-day forecast, which is then displayed on the app.
